# cs-courses

## Hi:wave:

This is a repo for cs-courses.

A collection of exercises in many cs-courses I have learned. Every course is organized as a git-submodule. You may click on the links below, which will bring you to the real repo.

For a better reading experience, you may check my [website](https://martinlwx.github.io)(Incomplete）. I put some solutions in #course tag.

### CS tools

- [x] [Missing-semester](https://github.com/MartinLwx/Missing-semester-2020-MIT) 🎥🏷⌨️ - 📅`2020`

Classes teach you all about advanced topics within CS, from operating systems to machine learning, but there’s one critical subject that’s rarely covered, and is instead left to students to figure out on their own: **proficiency with their tools**.

**Topics include**: *command-line*; *text editor*; *version control systems*

### Programming

- [x] [CS61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://github.com/MartinLwx/CS61A-Fall-2021-UCB) 🎥🏷⌨️⚙️ - 📅`Fall-2021`

An introduction to programming and computer science focused on abstraction techniques as means to **manage program complexity**. The course exposes students to programming paradigms, including **functional, object-oriented, and declarative approaches**. It includes an introduction to asymptotic analysis of algorithms. There are several significant programming projects.

**Topics include**: *procedural abstraction*; *control abstraction using recursion*; *higher-order functions*; *generators*; *streams*; *data abstraction*; *language abstraction*.

- [x] [CS110L: Safety in Systems Programming](https://github.com/MartinLwx/CS110L-Spring-2020-Stanford) 🎥🏷⌨️⚙️ - 📅`Spring-2020`

This class is focused on **safety and robustness in systems programming**: Where do things often go wrong in computer systems? How can we avoid common pitfalls? We will use the Rust programming language as a vehicle to teach mental models and paradigms that have been shown to be helpful in preventing errors, and we will look at how these features have made their way back into C++. 

**Topics include**: *error handling*; *memory safety*; *basic and intermediate rust programming*; *smart pointers*; *information security*; *scalability and availability*.

- [x] [CIS198. Rust Programming](https://github.com/MartinLwx/CIS198-Spring-2016-UPenn) 🏷⌨️⚙️ - 📅`Spring-2016`

In this course, we will cover what makes Rust so unique and apply it to practical systems programming problems. 

**Topics include**: *traits* and *generics*; *memory safety*; *move semantics*; *borrowing*; *lifetimes*; *rich macro system*; *closures*; *concurrency*. 


### Data Science

- [x] [Data100: Principles and Techniques of Data Science](https://github.com/MartinLwx/Data100-Fall-2021-UCB) 🎥🏷⌨️⚙️ - 📅`Fall-2021`

This intermediate level class bridges between [Data 8](http://data8.org/) and upper division computer science and statistics courses as well as methods courses in other fields. In this class, we explore **key areas of data science including question formulation**.

**Topics include**: *data collection and cleaning*; *visualization*; *statistical inference*; *predictive modeling*; and *decision making*.


### Deep Learning

- [x] [CS224W: Machine Learning with Graphs](https://github.com/MartinLwx/CS224W-Fall-2021-Stanford.git) 🎥🏷⌨️ - 📅`Fall-2021`

Complex data can be represented as a graph of relationships between objects. Such networks are a fundamental tool for modeling social, technological, and biological systems. This course focuses on the **computational, algorithmic, and modeling challenges specific to the analysis of massive graphs**. By means of studying the underlying graph structure and its features, students are introduced to machine learning techniques and data mining tools apt to reveal insights on a variety of networks.

**Topics include**: *representation learning and Graph Neural Networks*; *algorithms for the World Wide Web*; *reasoning over Knowledge Graphs*; *influence maximization*; *disease outbreak detection*, *social network analysis*.


## Progressing

- [ ] [6.005-Fall-2016](https://web.mit.edu/6.005/www/sp16/)

Software construction. Topics: *Testing*, *Version control*, *Interfaces* and *Abstract Data Types*, etc.
