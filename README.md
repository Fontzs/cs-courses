# cs-courses

## Hi:wave:

This is a repo for cs-courses.



A collection of exercises in many cs-courses I have learned. Every course is organized as a git-submodule. You may click on the links below, which will bring you to the real repo.



For a better reading experience, you may check my [website](https://martinlwx.github.io). I put some solutions in #course tag.
