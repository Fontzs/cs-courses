# cs-courses

## Hi:wave:

This is a repo for cs-courses.



A collection of exercises in many cs-courses I have learned. Every course is organized as a git-submodule. You may click on the links below, which will bring you to the real repo.



For a better reading experience, you may check my [website](https://martinlwx.github.io)(Incomplete）. I put some solutions in #course tag.

## Finished

### CS tools

-   [x] [Missing-semester-2020-MIT](https://github.com/MartinLwx/Missing-semester-2020-MIT)

Classes teach you all about advanced topics within CS, from operating systems to machine learning, but there’s one critical subject that’s rarely covered, and is instead left to students to figure out on their own: **proficiency with their tools**. We’ll teach you how to master the *command-line*, use *a powerful text editor*, use fancy features of *version control systems*, and much more!

### Programming

-   [x] [CS61A-Fall-2021-UCB](https://github.com/MartinLwx/CS61A-Fall-2021-UCB)

An introduction to programming and computer science focused on abstraction techniques as means to **manage program complexity**. Techniques include *procedural abstraction*; *control abstraction* using recursion, *higher-order functions*, *generators*, and *streams*; *data abstraction* using interfaces, *objects, classes, and generic operators*; and *language abstraction* using interpreters and macros. The course exposes students to programming paradigms, including functional, object-oriented, and declarative approaches. It includes an introduction to asymptotic analysis of algorithms. There are several significant programming projects.

### Data Science 

-   [x] [Data100-Fall-2021-UCB](https://github.com/MartinLwx/Data100-Fall-2021-UCB)

This intermediate level class bridges between [Data 8](http://data8.org/) and upper division computer science and statistics courses as well as methods courses in other fields. In this class, we explore key areas of data science including question formulation, **data collection and cleaning, visualization, statistical inference, predictive modeling, and decision making**.

## Progressing

-   [ ] [CS61B-Spring-2021-UCB](https://github.com/MartinLwx/CS61B-Spring-2021-UCB)

In CS 61B, we move to a somewhat more detailed (and to some extent, more basic) level of programming. Much of CS 61B will be concerned with the **tradeoffs in time and memory** for a variety of methods for structuring data. We’ll also be concerned with the *engineering* knowledge and skills needed to build and maintain moderately large programs.

-   [ ] [6.005-Fall-2016](https://web.mit.edu/6.005/www/sp16/)

Software construction. Topics: *Testing*, *Version control*, *Interfaces* and *Abstract Data Types*, etc. 

-   [ ] [CIS198-Spring-2016-UPenn](https://cis198-2016s.github.io)

In this course, we will cover what makes Rust so unique and apply it to practical systems programming problems. Topics covered will include *traits* and *generics*; *memory safety* (*move semantics*, *borrowing*, and *lifetimes*); Rust’s *rich macro system*; *closures*; and *concurrency*.
